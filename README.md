## About
> This project is deprecated and no longer maintained. 

BTDExp is an automation software built with [pyautogui](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui) to automatically grind exp for towers in Bloons Tower Defense Battles 2. Due to the poorly implemented exp system of the game, newer players are often unable to use the towers they desired without monetary purchases of boosts. BTDExp agentically plays the game, and thus generates exp for towers while the player is away.

## Installation

Both Mac and Windows versions of the game are supported. Mobile versions, however, are not supported.

For instructions on how to install, consult the [installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md).
