7. Open the folder and run `SETUP.bat`. Windows defender might block the program, in which case click `More Info > Run Anyways`
8. Follow the instructions presented to you
9. The software is now installed! (For how to run the software, consult [Running the software](#running-the-software))<br>

## Running the Sotftware

**IMPORTANT: Make sure your screen resolution is 1980x1080**

1. Open BTDB2, make sure it is in windowed mode, instead of fullscreen. Also make sure the window is taking up the whole screen, instead of having it as a small window.
2. Run `EXEC.bat` and follow the instructions presented. Again, windows defender might stop the program from running, in which case select `More Info > Run Anyways`
3. Return to the BTDB2 window, making sure that no other window is visible.

If you are using a multi-monitor setup, make sure that you put BTDB2 in the leftmost monitor (that is also 1920x1080). You may put the terminal that pops up when running `EXEC.bat` in another monitor
